#DESCRIPTION OF THESE TASK

I'll create a concise description of the real-time chat application I built for you.

This real-time chat application simulates WebSocket functionality in a browser-based environment. The application features a modern, responsive interface with a gradient background and clean white chat container.

Key features include:

User messaging with instant display of sent messages
Simulated responses from virtual users
Typing indicators that show when someone is composing a message
User avatars with initials and color-coding
Timestamp display for all messages
Online user counter
Username customization option
The interface is divided into three main sections:

A header displaying the chat room name, online user count, and username change button
A scrollable message area showing the conversation history
A message input area with send button
The application uses animations for a more dynamic feel, including message fade-in effects and typing indicator animations. While it simulates WebSocket behavior, it doesn't require an actual server connection, making it perfect for demonstration purposes.

The design follows modern UI principles with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and a color scheme based around indigo and purple tones. The code is written in HTML, CSS (using Tailwind), and JavaScript, making it completely self-contained and ready to use in any modern browser.
